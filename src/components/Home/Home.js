                <h1>The need for self-expression is an important part of our lives. When we don't 
                express ourselves, we repress important parts of who we are and cause ourselves 
                considerable struggle and lasting mental and emotional pain. Our frustration turns to 
                rage. Our isolation turns to depression. Our restlessness turns to panic. Finding 
                creative, healthy, productive ways to express ourselves, such as songwriting, poetry, 
                visual arts, gardening, cooking, and even speaking out loud in support group meetings, 
                can be the remedy to our painful, destructive patterns. Sobriety and recovery are 
                wonderful roads to creative expression.</h1>

                <h1>Spoken word, poetry, prose, and creative writing are all ways to express yourself 
                and what youâ€™re experiencing. Writing down and performing your thoughts can serve to 
                transform the intangibility of your emotions and experiences into something more.</h1>
